# RATS
### a game by grayson carter

# What the game is:

### I aim to make this game very similar to pokemon, but instead of your average pokemon world, you are actually in new york
#### Fighting rats with mutations
##### And occasionally homeless people

# Stuff currently in the game
## Map
## Basic User Movement
## I am currently working on a gym system

### There will be a turn-based combat system implemented soon(i am working on it right now)
#### The rest of the game is graphical, but choice based now because movement around the map didn't want to work. :)
